# UCSB GOLD Login Box Checker

This script checks the checkbox on UCSB GOLD's login page. Source code is
bundled for the user's persual and for those who would like to audit this.
I honestly suggest looking at it as the script does do things on a page that handles
 sensitive login details, however small that thing may be (2 lines). 

This script has been tested on Chrome. It should work for Firefox (with
Greasemonkey) and Opera as well. If the script breaks the login, follow your
browser's extension or userscript uninstallation procedures.

## Chrome

Click the link below, press continue on the download widget on the toolbar, and
click install. For uninstallation, uninstall this script as if you would
uninstall a Chrome extension for which you can see [Chrome's documentation]
(http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=113907) for details.

## Firefox

Install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
extension if you do not have it installed and click the link below after it is installed.
Follow through with the instructions to install it. For uninstallation, 
please read [this how-to](http://techie-buzz.com/how-to/uninstall-remove-greasemonkey-scripts.html)
on how to uninstall scripts.
